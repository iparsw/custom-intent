# Custom Intents

V0.7.6
(it's still in buggy alpha)

## a simple way to create chatbots Ai, image classification Ai and more!!

![Demo1](images/img2.png)

![Demo2](images/img.png)

A package build on top of keras for creating and training deep learning chatbots (text classification), binary image classification and linear regression models in just three lines of code 

the package is inspired by NeuralNine, neuralintents package a packege that let you build chatbot models with 3 lines of code

### Setting Up A Basic Chatbot

```python
from CustomIntents import ChatBot
chatbot = ChatBot(model_name="test_model", intents="intents.json")
assistant.train_model()
assistant.save_model()
done = False
while not done:
    message = input("Enter a message: ")
    if message == "STOP":
        done = True
    else:
        assistant.request(message)
```

### Binding Functions To Requests

this is inspired by neuralintents

```python
from CustomIntents import ChatBot
def function_for_greetings():
    print("You triggered the greetings intent!")
    # Some action you want to take
def function_for_stocks():
    print("You triggered the stocks intent!")
    # Some action you want to take
mappings = {'greeting' : function_for_greetings, 'stocks' : function_for_stocks}
assistant = ChatBot('intents.json', intent_methods=mappings ,model_name="test_model")
assistant.train_model()
assistant.save_model()
done = False
while not done:
    message = input("Enter a message: ")
    if message == "STOP":
        done = True
    else:
        assistant.request(message)
```
### Sample intents.json File
```json
{"intents": [
  {"tag": "greeting",
    "patterns": ["Hi", "Salam", "Nice to meet you", "Hello", "Good day", "Hey", "greetings"],
    "responses": ["Hello!", "Good to see you again!", "Hi there, how can I help?"]
  },
  {"tag": "goodbye",
    "patterns": ["bye", "good bye", "see you later"],
    "responses": ["bye", "good bye"],
    "context_set": ""
  },
  {"tag": "something",
    "patterns": ["something", "something else", "etc"],
    "responses": ["the response to something"],
  }
]
}
```

# ChatBot Class

the first class in CustomIntent package is ChatBot
its exacly what you thing a chatbot

## Init arguaments

```python
def __init__(self, intents, intent_methods, model_name="assistant_model", threshold=0.25, w_and_b=False,
             tensorboard=False):
```
intents : its the path of your intents file

intents_method : its a dictionary of mapped functions

model_name : its just the name of your model

threshold : its the accuracy threshold of your model its set to 0.25 by default

w_and_b : it will connect to wandb if set to True (you will need to login first)

tensorboard : Not available at the time

## Training

you can start training your model with one function call train_model

training model arguments :
```python
def train_model(self, epoch=None, batch_size=5, learning_rate=None,
                ignore_letters=None, timeIt=True, model_type='s1',
                validation_split=0, optimizer=None, accuracy_and_loss_plot=True):
```

epoch : an epoch basicly means training the neural network with all the training data for one cycle and this arguament says how many of this circles it will go

batch_size : Integer or None. Number of samples per gradient update (you can just ignore this)

learning_rate : Learning rate is a hyper-parameter that controls the weights of our neural network with respect to the loss gradient. It defines how quickly the neural network updates the concepts it has learned. (in simple terms if its bigger our model learn faster but it can go of track faster)

ignore_letters : a list of letters you want to ignore (by defualt it will ignore (? . , !) (you can pas a empty list if you dont want to ignore (?.,!)))

timeIt : it will just time the training

model_type : you can select one of the defined models (we will look at the available models later on)

validation_split : you can split a portion of your data for validation only (model will not get trained on them) it should be float between 0 and 1 (i will recommend to not create a validation split unless you have a really huge data set with lots of similar patterns)

optimizer : you can choose beetwin SGD, Adam, Adamx and Adagard

## save_model

it will save your model as two .pkl files and a .h5 file (don't add .h5 or .pkl)

```python
def save_model(self, model_name=None):
```

model_name : if its None (defualt), it will save the files like (model_name.h5)(model_name_words.pkl)(model_name_classes.pkl) where the model_name is the name you specified in the first place

## load_model

it will load a model from those three files

```python
def load_model(self, model_name=None):
```

model_name : if its None (defualt), it will look for files like (model_name.h5)(model_name_words.pkl)(model_name_classes.pkl) where the model_name is the name you specified in the first place

## request_tag

you will pass it a massege and it will return the predicted tag for you

```python
def request_tag(self, message, debug_mode=False, threshold=None):
```

message : the actual message

debug_mode : it will print every step of the procces for debuging perpes

threshold : you can set a accuracy threshold if not specified it will use the threshold you set when initilizing the bot and if you didn't specified there either it is set to 0.25 by default

## request_response

the same as request_tag but it will return a random response from intents

```python
def request_response(self, message, debug_mode=False, threshold=None):
```

## gradio_preview

it will open up a nice gui for testing your model in your browser

```python
def gradio_preview(self, ask_for_threshold=False, share=False, inbrowser=True):
```

ask_for_threshold : if set to True it will create a slider that you can set the threshold of the model with it

share : if set to True it will make the demo public

inbrowser : it will aoutomaticlly open a new browser page if set to True

![Demo](images/img.png)

## cli_preview

```python
def cli_preview(self):
```

a simple cli interface for testing your model

## gui_preview

a custom gui for triyng or even deploying your model

```python
def gui_preview(self, user_name=""):
```

user_name : it will only say hello to you if you pass your name for now

![Demo](images/img2.png)

## model types

you can choose one of the defined models according to the size of diffrente patterns and tags you have (you can just try and see wich one is right for your use case)

xs1 : a very fast and small model

xs2 : still small but better for more tags


s1 : the default model (hidden layers : 128-64)

s2 : its better than s1 when you have small number of similar tags that s1 cant predict

s3 : most of the time you dont need this (hidden layers : 128-64-64)

s4 : its like a s2 on streoid its suited when you have a lot of patterns for tags that have similar patterns

s5 : most of the time you dont need this either (hidden layers : 128-64-64-32)


m1 : great balance of perfomance and accuracy for medium size intent files

m2 : great accuracy for medium size intent files

m3 : m3 to m1 is like s2 to s1 its more suited when you have smaller number of tags but hard to difrentiat

l1 - l2 - l3 - l4 - l5 - xl1 - xl2 - xl3 - xl5 : are bigger models for more information read MODELS.md

# JsonIntents Class

this class is used to add and edit Json files containing intents
```python
def __init__(self, json_file_adrees):
```

you just need to pass the path of the json file the function you want

## add_pattern_app

its a function that ask you to input new patterns for tags (you can pass an especific tag to ask for that or it will cycle through them all and will go to the next tag by inputing D or d)

```python
def add_pattern_app(self, tag=None):
```

## add_tag_app

it will add new tags to your json file 

```python
def add_tag_app(self, tag=None, responses=None):
```
tag : the name of the new tag you want to add

responses : a list of responses (you can add later on as well)

## delete_duplicate_app

it will check for duplicate in patterns and deletes them for you

## an example of using this class

```python
file = JsonIntents("internet intents.json")
file.delete_duplicate_app()
file.add_tag_app(tag="about")
file.add_pattern_app("about")
```

```

data_folder : the path to where you located your data

model_name : name your model

number_of_classes : number of difrent classes you have in your data (you should put the pictures of every class in a sub folder in your data folder)

classes_name : a list of names correspunding to your classes (they should be the same as the folder name of correspunding data folder for example if you have 3 sub folder in your data folder as banana apple pineapple you should pass ["banana", "apple", "pineapple"])

gpu : you can pass True or False if you dont pass anything it will try to use your gpu if you have a cuda enaibled graphic card and you have cudatoolkit and cuDNN installed and if you dont it will use your cpu

## Training

you can start training your model with one function call train_model

training model arguments :

model_type : you can select one of the defined models (we will look at the available models later on)

logdir : a directory to hold your tensorboard log files you can leave is empty if you dont care

optimizer_type : you can only choose adam right now

learning_rate : Learning rate is a hyper-parameter that controls the weights of our neural network with respect to the loss gradient. It defines how quickly the neural network updates the concepts it has learned. (in simple terms if its bigger our model learn faster but it can go of track faster)

class_weight : if you have an unbalanced dataset you can path a dictionary with the weight that you what to assosiate with every class () 

prefetching : prefetching data

plot_model : it will plot the model architecture for you 

validation_split : you can split a portion of your data for validation only (model will not get trained on them) it should be float between 0 and 1 (i will recommend to not create a validation split unless you have a really huge data set with lots of similar patterns)

## save_model

it will save your model a .h5 file

```python
def save_model(self, model_file_name=None):
```

image_type : if its None (defualt), it will it will try to detect if the image is a cv2 image or a numpy array of the image or a path to the image

full_mode : if you set it to true it will return every class and its probability

accuracy : if you set it to true it will return a tuple of the class name and the probability

(if both full_mode and accuracy set to false (defualt behavier) it will just return the most likly class name)

## realtime prediction

it will predict from a live video feed (it will open a live cv2 video feed)

```python
def realtime_prediction(self, src=0):
```

src : if you have multiple webcams or virtual webcams it will let you choose from them if you only have one live it empty

## realtime face prediction

its exacly like the realtime_prediction() method but it will detect facec with a haarcascadde and will feed the model with the facec to predict

```python
def realtime_face_prediction(self, src=0, frame_rate=5):
```

src : if you have multiple webcams or virtual webcams it will let you choose from them if you only have one live it empty

frame_rate : its the number of frames to skip before predicting again


## gradio_preview

it will open up a nice gui for testing your model in your browser

```python
def gradio_preview(self, share=False, inbrowser=True):
```

share : if set to True it will make the demo public

inbrowser : it will aoutomaticlly open a new browser page if set to True

## example of using BinaryImageClassificator

in this example i have a folder in data/full that contains 4 sub folders (beni, khodm, matin, parsa) and in every one of them i have a lot of pictures of my friends (the folder name corredpunds to their names for example in beni folder there are beni's pictures, btw khodm means myself in my languge) and i want to train a model to detect which one of us we are in the picture

```python
from CustomIntents import ImageClassificator

model = ImageClassificator(model_name="test_m1", data_folder="data/full", number_of_classes=4, classes_name=["beni", "khodm", "matin", "parsa"])
model.train_model(epochs=10, model_type="m1", logdir="logs", learning_rate=0.0001, prefetching=False)
model.save_model(model_file_name="test_m1")
```
```python
from CustomIntents import BinaryImageClassificator

model = ImageClassificator(model_name="test_m1", data_folder="data/full", number_of_classes=4, classes_name=["beni", "khodm", "matin", "parsa"])
model.load_model(name="test_m1")
result = model.realtime_face_prediction()
```
